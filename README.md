# Enge Vibings Website
This website is made to replace the [linktree](linktr.ee/engevibings) to support my board game. This way you also don't have to open the different programs I made for this game so everything can quickly be used. There are also some fun party games like Would You Rather and Truth Or Dare.

## Installation

1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) if you don't have them yet.
2. Press 'clone' on the GitLab page.
3. Choose 'Open in your IDE' > 'Visual Studio Code (HTTPS)'.
4. Select a folder where you want the project to be.
5. Then press open.
6. You have now successfully installed the project.

## Usage

If you want to run the code, you have to install the 'Live Server' extension. Then you have to press 'Go Live' on the bottom right of the screen.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For other changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
